# Voice-to-text-synthesis
This Python Flask web application retrieves video data, transcribes the content, and creates brief summaries by utilizing the YouTube API and the Gemini AI Transcription API. These summaries can be saved by users as text files for later use. The program also has the ability to translate text using the Google Translation Module, making Marathi and Hindi versions of the UI and generated summaries available. This guarantees a multilingual strategy, reaching a larger audience.
